A collection of projects in an attempt to improve my machine learning skills
Linear regression model that takes premier league stats from the 2017/2018 season to train a linear regression model to make predictions using other season's data 
Other ideas include: p-value tests using statsmodel libraries to see which variables are statistically linked to more goals (WIP)
