# Machine_learning_projects
A collection of projects in an attempt to improve my machine learning skills
1. Building a Linear Regression model that can predict insurance rates based on health insurance features from Kaggle
   a. Started by exploring the dataset and working out relationships between features
   b. Trained an ML model
   c. Evaluated and refined model

3. Linear regression model that takes premier league stats from the 2017/2018 season to train a linear regression model to make predictions using other season's data 
Other ideas include: p-value tests using statsmodel libraries to see which variables are statistically linked to more goals (WIP)
